### Laravel Docker Container Service

- [Laravel 10](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/releases)

- [PHP-FPM 8.3](https://www.php.net/releases/8.3/en.php)

- [Nginx 1.24](https://nginx.org/)

- [Alpine Linux 3.19](https://www.alpinelinux.org/)

### MariaDB Docker Container Service

- [MariaDB 10.11](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-1011/)

- [Alpine Linux 3.19](https://www.alpinelinux.org/)

### Project objetives with Docker

* Built on the lightweight and secure Alpine Linux distribution
* Multi-platform, supporting AMD4, ARMv6, ARMv7, ARM64
* Very small Docker image size (+/-40MB)
* Uses PHP 8.3 for the best performance, low CPU usage & memory footprint
* Optimized for 100 concurrent users
* Optimized to only use resources when there's traffic (by using PHP-FPM's `on-demand` process manager)
* The services Nginx, PHP-FPM and supervisord run under a non-privileged user (nobody) to make it more secure
* The logs of all the services are redirected to the output of the Docker container (visible with `docker logs -f <container name>`)
* Follows the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid) to make it easy to understand and adjust the image to your needs

## Project as Service

The goal of this container image is to provide a start up application with the basic enviroment to deploy a php service running with Nginx and PHP-FPM in a container which follows the best practices and is easy to understand and modify to your needs.

Thus not includes a database neither other services like message broker or mailing, etc.

## Usage on Windows systems

You can use the makefile that comes with this repository or manually update the [./docker/.env](./docker/.env) file to feed the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Usage on Unix based systems

Makefiles are often used to automate the process of building and compiling software on Unix-based systems, including Linux and macOS.

## Reset configurations on the run
In [docker/config/](docker/config/) you'll find the default configuration files for Nginx, PHP and PHP-FPM.

If you want to extend or customize that you can do so by mounting a configuration file in the correct folder;

Nginx configuration:
```
$ docker run -v "`pwd`/nginx-server.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/server.conf" ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}
```

PHP configuration:
```
$ docker run -v "`pwd`/php-setting.ini:/etc/php83/conf.d/settings.ini" ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}
```

PHP-FPM configuration:
```
$ docker run -v "`pwd`/php-fpm-settings.conf:/etc/php83/php-fpm.d/server.conf" ${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}
```

_Note; Because `-v` requires an absolute path I've added `pwd` in the example to return the absolute path to the current directory_


## Troubleshoots

If you want to connect to another container running your local machine *(for e.g.: database, bucket)* use your ip to do so *(not localhost or 127.0.0.1)*.

Find out your IP on UNIX systems and take the first ip listed
```
$ hostname -I

191.128.1.41 172.17.0.1 172.20.0.1 172.21.0.1
```

Find out your IP on Windows as `administrator user` and take the first ip listed
```
C:\WINDOWS\system32>ipconfig /all

Windows IP Configuration

 Host Name . . . . . . . . . . . . : 191.128.1.41
 Primary Dns Suffix. . . . . . . . : paul.ad.cmu.edu
 Node Type . . . . . . . . . . . . : Peer-Peer
 IP Routing Enabled. . . . . . . . : No
 WINS Proxy Enabled. . . . . . . . : No
 DNS Suffix Search List. . . . . . : scs.ad.cs.cmu.edu
```

## Check Laravel status

Visiting `http://localhost:8888/` should display Laravel's welcome page.

Use an API platform *(Postman, Firefox RESTClient, etc..)* to check connection with Laravel
```
GET: http://localhost:8888/api/v1/health

{
    "status": true
}
```

## Database

Check connection to database through a test endpoint. If conenction params are not set already will response as follows
```
GET: http://localhost:8888/api/v1/health/db

{
    "status": false,
    "message": "Connect to database failed - Check connection params.",
    "error": {
        "errorInfo": [
            "HY000",
            2002,
            "Host is unreachable"
        ]
    }
}
```

Complete the MySQL database connection params. Use local hostname IP `$ make hostname` to set `DB_HOST` variable
```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=192.168.1.41
DB_PORT=8889
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=laravel
DB_PASSWORD=123456
```

Checking the connection to database once is set correctly will response as follows
```
GET: http://localhost:8888/api/v1/health/db

{
    "status": true
}
```
